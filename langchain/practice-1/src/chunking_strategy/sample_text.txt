FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
It is based on standard Python type hints and provides automatic validation, serialization, and documentation generation.

One of FastAPI's biggest advantages is its performance.
It is built on Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for data handling, making it extremely fast and efficient.

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc.
This allows developers to quickly test endpoints and understand request and response formats without writing extra documentation.

Another important feature is dependency injection.
FastAPI allows developers to define reusable dependencies for authentication, database connections, and request validation.

FastAPI is widely used for building microservices, machine learning APIs, and real-time applications.
It integrates well with async frameworks and modern deployment pipelines.

In production environments, FastAPI applications are often deployed using Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms.
Proper logging, monitoring, and scaling strategies are essential for maintaining reliability and performance.

Security is also a critical consideration.
FastAPI supports OAuth2, JWT authentication, CORS middleware, and secure headers to protect APIs from common vulnerabilities.

Overall, FastAPI provides a clean developer experience, high performance, and strong ecosystem support, making it a popular choice for modern backend development.
