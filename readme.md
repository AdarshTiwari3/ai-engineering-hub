# AI Engineering Hub

**AI Engineering Hub** is a personal learning and experimentation repository focused on building real-world AI systems with an engineering mindset.

The primary focus is on:

* **Generative AI (LLMs)**
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
* **Agent-based workflows (LangChain, LangGraph)**
* **Production-ready backend integration and system design**

This repository focuses on practical experimentation and hands-on learning in modern AI engineering, emphasizing real-world system building rather than isolated model usage.
